# Stormwater Game
This is an educational web game about green stormwater infrastructure (intended for middle/high schoolers), which will be used by the environmental science curriculum chairs of the [Moelis Access Science](https://www.nettercenter.upenn.edu/what-we-do/programs/university-assisted-community-schools/moelis-access-science) program when co-developing and facilitating hands-on, inquiry-based activities, labs, and lessons for West Philadelphia students.

The game can be used in any activity with the accompanying [lesson plan](lesson-plan.pdf), though it can also be added in as a final activity in any green stormwater infrastructure lesson.
